# Clinical Trials Portal

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for managing and displaying clinical trials data, built for AstraZeneca. The application provides a modern, responsive interface for browsing clinical trials with advanced filtering and search capabilities. It features a React frontend with a comprehensive design system, an Express.js backend API, and PostgreSQL database integration through Drizzle ORM.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side is built using modern React with TypeScript, implementing a component-based architecture:

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **UI Framework**: Custom design system built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS
- **Component Library**: Comprehensive shadcn/ui component library for consistent design patterns
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

The frontend follows a modular structure with reusable components, custom hooks, and a well-organized file structure separating UI components, pages, and utilities.

### Backend Architecture
The server-side implements a RESTful API architecture:

- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for robust server-side development
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints following standard HTTP conventions
- **Data Layer**: Abstracted storage interface allowing for flexible data persistence strategies
- **Development Storage**: In-memory storage implementation with sample data for development
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware for consistent API responses
- **Request Logging**: Comprehensive request/response logging for debugging and monitoring

### Data Storage Solutions
The application is designed for PostgreSQL integration with flexible storage abstractions:

- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations and schema management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless integration for scalable cloud deployment
- **Schema Management**: Code-first approach with Drizzle migrations and type generation
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type validation and data integrity
- **Storage Interface**: Abstract storage layer supporting multiple implementations (memory, database)

### Authentication and Authorization
The application includes infrastructure for user management:

- **User Schema**: Defined user entity with username/password authentication
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store integration for persistent sessions
- **Security**: Password hashing and secure session handling (implementation pending)

### Design System and Styling
Comprehensive design system built for healthcare/pharmaceutical branding:

- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS with custom AstraZeneca brand colors and design tokens
- **Component System**: Complete shadcn/ui integration with customized theming
- **Typography**: Professional font stack including Inter and custom Google Fonts
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first responsive design patterns throughout
- **Accessibility**: ARIA-compliant components and keyboard navigation support

### Development Experience
Optimized development workflow and tooling:

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage across client, server, and shared code
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting
- **Development Server**: Vite dev server with HMR and Express integration
- **Build Process**: Optimized production builds with code splitting and asset optimization
- **Path Aliases**: Configured import aliases for clean, maintainable code organization
